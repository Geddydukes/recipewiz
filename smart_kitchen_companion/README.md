## AI Recipe Features Setup

To use the AI-powered recipe features:

1. Get a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Copy `lib/config/api_keys.template.dart` to `lib/config/api_keys.dart`
3. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual Gemini API key

Note: The `api_keys.dart` file is gitignored to protect your API key. Never commit this file to version control.
